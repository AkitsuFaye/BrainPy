    description: |
        BrainPy is a lightweight framework based on the latest Just-In-Time (JIT)
        compilers (especially [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)). The goal of
        BrainPy is to provide a unified simulation and analysis framework for neuronal
        dynamics with the feature of high flexibility and efficiency. BrainPy is
        flexible because it endows the users with the fully data/logic flow control.
        BrainPy is efficient because it supports JIT acceleration on CPUs  and GPUs.
