    "There are basically two types of neuron models - conductance-based models and simplified models. In conductance-based models, a single neuron can be regarded as a electric circuit, where the membrane is a capacitor, ion channels are conductors, and ion gradients are batteries. The neuronal activity is captured by the current flow through those ion channels. Sometimes there is an external input to this neuron, which can also be included in the equivalent circuit (see the figure below which shows potassium channels, sodium channels and leaky channels).\n",
